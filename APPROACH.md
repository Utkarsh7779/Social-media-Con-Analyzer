# Technical Approach - Social Media Content Analyzer

## Problem-Solving Strategy

I approached this project with a focus on **user experience first**, then **technical robustness**. The core challenge was creating a seamless file processing pipeline that handles both PDFs and images while providing actionable insights.

## Architecture Decisions

**Full-Stack Separation**: Chose React + Node.js for clear separation of concerns. Frontend handles UI/UX, backend manages file processing and analysis.

**File Processing Pipeline**: Implemented a unified upload endpoint that automatically detects file type and routes to appropriate processor (PDF-parse for PDFs, Tesseract.js for OCR).

**Content Analysis Algorithm**: Developed custom engagement metrics using Flesch Reading Ease scoring, sentence structure analysis, and social media best practices to generate actionable suggestions.

## Technical Implementation

**Frontend**: Modern React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for responsive design, and React Dropzone for intuitive file handling. Implemented tabbed results display for better information organization.

**Backend**: Express.js with comprehensive error handling, file validation, and automatic cleanup. Used Helmet for security headers and Morgan for logging.

**Performance**: Optimized for real-time processing with loading states, progress indicators, and efficient file handling (10MB limit, automatic cleanup).

## Key Innovations

- **Unified Processing**: Single endpoint handles multiple file types seamlessly
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-like recommendations based on content analysis
- **Security First**: File validation, size limits, and automatic cleanup
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with modern UI components

The solution balances technical complexity with user simplicity, providing enterprise-grade functionality in an accessible package.
